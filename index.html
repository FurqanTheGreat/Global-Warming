      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily burning fossil fuels that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Pakistan, like many other countries, is experiencing the adverse effects of global warming.
      </p>
      <p>
        The impact of global warming on Pakistan is multifaceted and has far-reaching consequences for the country's environment, economy, and society. The following sections highlight some of the key effects of global warming on Pakistan.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="rising-temperatures">
      <h2>Rising Temperatures</h2>
      <p>
        Pakistan has been observing a gradual increase in temperatures over the past few decades. Rising temperatures lead to heatwaves, which have severe implications for human health, agriculture, and ecosystems. Crop yields decline, water resources deplete, and the risk of diseases such as heatstroke rises.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, rising temperatures contribute to the expansion of desert areas, particularly in regions like Thar. This further aggravates the scarcity of arable land and affects livelihoods, as agriculture becomes more challenging.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heatwaves and prolonged periods of extreme heat also put additional strain on energy infrastructure, leading to increased demand for electricity and higher cooling needs. This poses challenges to an already burdened power sector, resulting in power outages and affecting daily life and businesses.
      </p>

    <section id="water-scarcity">
      <h2>Water Scarcity</h2>
      <p>
        Global warming exacerbates water scarcity issues in Pakistan. The changing climate patterns disrupt the water cycle, resulting in irregular rainfall patterns and reduced water availability. This affects agriculture, as farmers struggle to irrigate their fields, and also impacts access to clean drinking water for the general population.
      </p>
      <p>
        The increased frequency and intensity of droughts further compound the water scarcity problem. As a predominantly agrarian country, Pakistan heavily relies on water resources for irrigation and hydropower generation, making water scarcity a critical concern for its economy and food security.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Indus River, the lifeline of Pakistan, depends on glacial meltwater, which is declining due to global warming-induced glacial melting. This affects the flow of water throughout the river system, impacting agricultural productivity and hydropower generation, as well as ecosystems and biodiversity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="glacial-melting">
      <h2>Glacial Melting</h2>
      <p>
        Pakistan is home to glaciers, including those in the Karakoram and Himalayan mountain ranges. However, global warming has accelerated the melting of these glaciers. This not only leads to a loss of freshwater resources but also increases the risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which pose a threat to nearby communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Glacial meltwater contributes significantly to Pakistan's river systems, including the Indus River, which is a lifeline for the country's agriculture and hydropower. The reduction in glacier volume affects the availability of freshwater downstream, impacting agricultural productivity and energy generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, glacial retreat affects the long-term availability of water resources for drinking, sanitation, and industrial purposes. It also has consequences for ecosystems, as the unique biodiversity that depends on glacial habitats faces habitat loss and potential extinction risks.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="extreme-weather">
      <h2>Extreme Weather Events</h2>
      <p>
        Global warming contributes to the occurrence of more frequent and intense extreme weather events in Pakistan. This includes intense rainfall, floods, and cyclones. These events result in loss of lives, damage to infrastructure, and displacement of communities, further exacerbating the socioeconomic challenges faced by the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        The devastating floods in recent years, such as those in 2010 and 2014, have caused significant human and economic losses. These events disrupt livelihoods, destroy homes and infrastructure, and pose long-term challenges for recovery and reconstruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, increased rainfall intensity leads to soil erosion and landslides, further impacting agriculture and posing risks to communities residing in hilly regions. The vulnerability of coastal areas to sea-level rise and storm surges also increases, threatening coastal communities and infrastructure.
